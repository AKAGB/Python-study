# PhantomJS

> PhantomJS is a headless WebKit scriptable with a JavaScript API. It has fast and native support for various web standards: DOM handling, CSS selector, JSON, Canvas, and SVG.

## Why using PhantomJS

When I tried to get the webpage by using `requests`, I found I could'n get some contents such as the text in `iframe` in the webpage. Later I knew that these contents was generated by javacsript. So I need something to run the javascript code and get the content I want. It is why I study phantomJS.

## Install PhantomJS

My OS is `deepin 15.5`. So I can use command line to install PhantomJS:

```
sudo apt-get install phantomJS
```

## Simple example

Create a javascript file named `helloworld.js`:

```javascript
// Filename: helloworld.js
console.log('hello, world');
phantom.exit()
```

Don't forget `phantom.exit()` otherwise you can't exit the program. The you can enter the command in the terminal to run this code:

```bash
$ phantomjs helloworld.js
hello, world
```
