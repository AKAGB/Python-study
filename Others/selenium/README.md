# Selenium

## What is selenium

Selenium automates browsers. That's it! What you do with that power is entirely up to you. Primarily, it is for automating web applications for testing purposes, but is certainly not limited to just that. Boring web-based administration tasks can (and should!) be automated as well.

Selenium has the support of some of the largest browser vendors who have taken (or are taking) steps to make Selenium a native part of their browser. It is also the core technology in countless other browser automation tools, APIs and frameworks.

## Why selenium

When I wrote a web crawler to get web page, I found it was diffierent from the real web page in browser. That is because there are some contents generated by run javascript code. Later I know that I can use selenium and phantomjs to get the dynamic web page.

## Install

My OS is `deepin 15.5`. So I can enter the cammand line in termial to install selenium.

```bash
$ sudo pip3 install selenium
```

## Simple example

```python
from selenium import webdriver

browser = webdriver.Chrome()
browser.get('http://www.dreamgqk.cn/')
```

This code will open a web page in chrome.
